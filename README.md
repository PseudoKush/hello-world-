# hello-world-
trying out GitHub first time

Hey this is PseudoKush here!
I am a beginner in the programming world who is trying to learn as much as possible about different languages and domains.
I am a real slacker but now trying to bring out more productiveness out of me so as to build a solid skill set and bring myself to a level which my friends have reached long ago. 
I hope i succeed. :)
